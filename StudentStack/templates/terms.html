                        Black Code sometimes requires application users to pay some certain fees for courses materials. This fee along with donations, is what we use to maintain our site. If you agree to pay the fees for Assignment help and past questions or make donations, you authorize us to charge your debit card or process other means of payment. Black Code works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient payment methods in your country to keep your payment information secure. When you make a purchase or make a donation, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorised payment method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the materials you pay for, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty days of notification from us.
